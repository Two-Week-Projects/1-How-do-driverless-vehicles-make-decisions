# 1-How-do-driverless-vehicles-make-decisions

This repository is dedicated to the ["How do driverless vehicles make decisions?" Two Week Project on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbrCQlZ-AYE&t=484s) completed in November 2020.

This video game aims to shed some light on the decision-making processes that driverless vehicles make, veering away from things like image recognition and instead focussing more on how vehicles navigate obstacles and other road users.

This project was completed within two weeks (hence the name of the YouTube channel), and so you should absolutely expect to see many bugs (or features), and should not expect it to be particularly exciting.

## What is this?

This is a video game built using Unreal Engine 4, version 4.25. The entire project is open source (under GPL3.0 license) so you can download the source code, modifiy it, hack it, break it, steal it, I don't care. If, god forbid, you find a use for it, all I ask is that you attribute me (under GPL 3.0 license conditions).

If you don't have UE4 and/or you don't want to build from source, then you can download an executable of the game [here](https://github.com/Two-Week-Projects/1-How-do-driverless-vehicles-make-decisions/releases/tag/BanditAF), available on Windows for anyone that wants to play the game.

## How do you actually play the game? (What are the controls, etc.)

The menus aim to be self explanatory, but if there is demand for it I am more than happy to write up full documentation in the near future.
The controls when in levels are:
```
  Q - Pause menu
  Esc - also Pause menu
  C - change car to focus on
  Ctrl+W - enter god's perspective mode
```
